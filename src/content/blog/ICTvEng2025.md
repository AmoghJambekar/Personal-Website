# Thoughts on the Indian Cricket Team's Tour of England

Hey everyone,  
This is a random post but I just wanted to talk about the **Indian Cricket Team‚Äôs selected squad** for the tour of England.

By the way, this website is now complete and on a link! Let me know if you like it.


## Captaincy Decisions

Let's start with the first player on the roster. 

The captain of India is often the biggest player on the team. Kohli, Rohit, Gavaskar, Ganguly, Dhoni are all names that we know and love who were all huge captains.

That being said, I am happy for **Shubman Gill** being named captain and it‚Äôs not undeserved given his recent form and grooming. But let‚Äôs be honest:

> **KL Rahul deserved the captaincy.**

He hass been vice-captain for years, has captained in **SENA** conditions, and brings experience. The real reason he probably lost out is his flexibility ‚Äî being pushed around the batting order from **1 to 7** ‚Äî and inconsistency in role. At one point, he was not being considered while **Gill** played at 1

But honestly, I don't mind that. 

## Why is Rishabh Pant vice-capatin?

Pant is an excellent player, but his leadership record is underwhelming:

- Poor returns as T20I captain  
- Mediocre stint with Delhi in the IPL  
- Questionable decision-making under pressure

Here‚Äôs a brutal stat from IPL 2025:

> **Pant has scored 151 runs** (with 63 in one match)  
> **Average:** 13.73  
> **Strike Rate:** 107.09  
> **Cost per run (USD):** \$2,032,778.15

And **LSG are 6th**, mostly surviving due to **Pooran** and **Mitch Marsh**. If you‚Äôre rewarding leadership, **KL Rahul** makes far more sense as VC.

Now given that Rahul has flourished as a pure batter, this decision does fall in line. But I would rather have had no vice-captain or even Bumrah who will play 3-4 matches out of 5 than Pant.



## Batting Breakdown

### Core 
- **Yashasvi Jaiswal** ‚Äî a lock after a sensational 18 months.  
- **Shubman Gill** ‚Äî captain and future of Indian batting.  
- **KL Rahul** ‚Äî still India‚Äôs most complete batter across formats.  
- **Sai Sudharsan** ‚Äî richly deserved call-up. Look at his numbers!
- **Karun Nair** ‚Äî great redemption story and deserved call.

### Backups
- **Abhimanyu Easwaran** ‚Äî has waited forever. But if you‚Äôre not going to play him now, then **why not give that slot to Sarfaraz Khan? Or Shreyas Iyer?**
- **Dhruv Jurel** ‚Äî right now, India‚Äôs best backup Test keeper.



## All-Rounders & Bowling Unit

### Seam-Bowling All-Rounders
- **Nitish Kumar Reddy** should be India‚Äôs long-term #6. Huge potential.  
- **Shardul Thakur** ‚Äî always a handy option in England.  
- **Washington Sundar** ‚Äî fits the format; can be valuable.

But the **omission of Axar Patel** still feels odd. He just won you a CT. He's great overseas. Look at his record with DC as captain, make him VC!

### Spin Attack
- **Kuldeep Yadav** ‚Äî finally getting the consistent backing he deserves.  
- **Jadeja** ‚Äî still world-class, but it‚Äôs time India starts playing **Kotian** for post-Jadeja succession. With the retirements of Kohli and Rohit, he should really step down.

### Fast Bowlers
- **Bumrah** ‚Äî elite when fit. The üêê. But he can't play many so it makes sense why other are.  
- **Siraj** and **Arshdeep** - Both really **SHOULD** play. SENA demands less spin and Thakur would be a better #4 bowling option
- **Prasidh Krishna** and **Akash Deep** will likely split matches when Bumrah is off.
- **Shami** ‚Äî Good decision to not pick him. Not in form, will not succeed.



## Selection Dilemmas

- Do you play **Arshdeep as the 3rd seamer**, or back Reddy/Thakur?
- Does **Jadeja's continued presence** slow down development of younger spinners?
- And the big one: **Shreyas Iyer not even in the India A setup**. He is literally scoring runs for fun right now. He's a future India captain.

Iyer has flaws given his "weakness" against pace and injury history but realistically he's still better than several selected. If you‚Äôre backing Nair, why not Iyer? 



## Bigger Picture

India has been:

- Runners-up in **two** WTC finals  
- Third in **one**

This cycle must end with the mace. A **young, aggressive squad** could finally get it done.

Also, I'd like to point out that the leadership triangle of **Gill (C)**, **Pant (VC)**, and **Gambhir (mentor)** will be worth watching. Three strong personalities, lots of ambition, and some clash potential too. Gambhir literally doesn't like Pant.
