Hey everyone\!

This is my second blog entry since making this website. This is now actually a website too\!

## **Highlights and Lowlights**

* Today was a much much day in terms of productivity.  
* I woke up early, got matcha (and nearly arrested along with it), knocked out the blog, finished the password protection on the photos and the entire photos page, and uploaded this codebase to a website. I am proud to announce this website is done. It took way too long.  
* I also hopped on two great calls and had two great conversations. Shout out to you guys\!  
* Made some awesome eats and drinks (and bought some) and not depicted is how I even made pasta tonight.  
* I also played some basketball (check my Strava) but I really do suck lol

I’d rate today a **9.5/10**. Not bad, could be better\!

Tomorrow, I want to start my first personal project and add this website to the list of personal projects I made. I might also buy a domain for it. I never uploaded those documents from today so I’ll do that tomorow. I’ll be tuning into the Knicks game, so lets pray they win 🙏

Thanks for reading and have a good night.
