Hey everyone!

<br>

This is my first blog entry since making this website. 

<br>

## Highlights and Lowlights

- Today was a great day in terms of productivity. I was able to get nearly all of this website done (took me a little too long), but I'm still cramped on the photo portfolio. I'm in two minds whether or not I want to finish that or move towards a personal project, so I'll make a decision soon.  
- I saw the Knicks bottle yet another game at home...  
<br>

I'd rate today a **8/10**. Not bad, could be better!

A song that was stuck in my head today was [**Feel the Fiyaaah by Metro Boomin' and A$AP Rocky**](https://open.spotify.com/track/3SsJ17EnPIu1B4GZshqjIS?si=9476c564e7424bfa). Great song, album is still super underrated despite the insane production and features!

Tomorrow, I have a call and need to pick up a small notebook from Staples. Ideally, I want to polish out the blog completely and get one photo album working on this iste, as well as configure a domain so I can put it up. After, I have to submit some random assignments and then I want to go on a run or play basketball ideally.

Thanks for reading and have a good night.
