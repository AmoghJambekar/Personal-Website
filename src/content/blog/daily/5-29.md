Hey everyone!<br /><br />

Here's today's blog.<br /><br />
## Highlights and Lowlights<br />

* Woke up on time somehow today and was still late...but I managed to make some Avacado toast on my new sourdough bread and still get the bus. Very good recipie, hire me as your private chef
* Started off in CS (where I talked about the Knicks with my teacher), then off to finish a project, then getting some points back in Physics and leaving Physics to play basketball and then not being able to actually play basketball in physics.
* Got home, made food with the same sourdough bread where I made a tomato mozzerella caprese. sooooooo good
* I had work after that and got put onto a really good matcha recipie at the boba shop from a guy who works there...and then forgot my bag in my sister's car so I couldn't do anything for the rest of the night besides watch the knicks game. It was so good I had to email my CS teacher in the middle of it. Amazing
* I slept early and got everything done and on time again so I think that's pretty nice.
<br /><br />
I'd rate today a 9/10. It was in the right direction and better than yesterday.
