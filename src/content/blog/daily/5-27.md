Hey everyone!<br /><br />

Today was my first day back to school, so first blog back!<br /><br />
## Highlights and Lowlights<br />

* Hated getting up early but since i've been fixed to this breakfast I had to have some before heading out. IDK how I was able to make it.<br />
* Started the morning off finishing my resume, reaching out to a couple people / finding some things to do over the summer. Had a fun lunch period (sausage party) and got cooked in basketball during school. Then mainly just walked around during Physics.
* Didn't really have a goal today! Mainly the resume and after that I was free I'd say.
* Got home, made some borgors and headed out to hoop for a bit. After, went to go play cricket (genuinely the most exhausting game of cricket I have ever played) and came home to clean up and watch the Knicks game.
* What is going on with my New York Knicks...Please win Thursday and take it to 6
* I fell asleep in the middle of the game tho and somehow got myself upstairs and to bed.
<br /><br />
I'd rate today a 7/10. Just plain to be honest, back to the school grind.
<br /><br />

More school tomorrow, and my goal is to get some points back on my Physics test, do a couple random errands and finish two assignments.<br /><br />

Thanks for reading and have a good day.<br /><br />
