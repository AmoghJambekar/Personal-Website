Hey everyone!<br /><br />

Here's today's blog.
## Highlights and Lowlights<br />

* Actually woke up late today and had to get dropped off to school. I was so exhausted from the day before.
* Started the morning off finishing a school project and then didn't really overwhelm myself with a lot of stuff during the day because I didn't really have much. I played some lockdown defense in gym basketball but still cannot shoot for jawn...please give me tips
* Got home, made food (and nearly burned down my house with it when i left the gas going...) and just had a few calls which were fun
* I then didn't have to work out so I just finished some more work, reformatted my resume like I had to and finished another assignment
* I slept early and got everything done and on time so I think that's pretty nice.
<br /><br />
I'd rate today a 8.5/10. It was in the right direction.
<br /><br />

More school tomorrow, and my goal is to get some points back on my Physics test (because my teacher ducked today) and start figuring out what I want to build next.<br /><br />

Thanks for reading and I hope you like this as much as I like making them. <br /><br />
