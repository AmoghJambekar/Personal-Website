Hey everyone!<br /><br />

This weekend was amazing and super fun for me but because of that I wasn't able to write any blog posts. Here's what I did, starting from Friday.<br /><br />
## Highlights and Lowlights<br />

* I woke up Friday celebrating the Knicks 111-94 in MSG and was certain we were gonna take it to Game 7. Little did I know...
* The main things I had to do on Friday was get on a call, write the day before's blog, finish some test corrections and submit a project. I got all of that done and also wanted to get a membership at a gym but wasn't able to get that so I just did it the day after. 
* Saturday, I planned to go to NYC to the Knicks watch party. For that, I woke up early and got my membership after taking my dog to the vet. After, I got my membership and lightly worked out, swam, saunaed and hooped. 
* It's always crazy how every day at a new gym is just the most unproductive day ever.
* After I got home, I got ready to head out and went straight to the WTC because MSG had no watch parties.
* Turns out there was no watch party at the WTC! So from there, I took a long walk to L'industrie West Village where the line was a block down the door.  We then opted for Mama's Too instead. 
* I got the house slice or whatever but the waiter was so rude lol...guess that's NYC
* The slce was good but I'm not sure if it was as hype as it seems. I feel like given the same base I would've been able to make it. The texture is great, the flavor is standard. 7/10.
* I then took a Subway to Central Park and snuck in to the Watch Party there after pretending like I was registered for it at the end of the second quarter. 
* Horrible, horrible loss. Idk what they can even do from here. Trade for Austin Reaves
* Took the subway back and a train back home. The subway is so funny. I walked out of the ticketed admitted area for a snack and let some Jamacian dude who said "thank you mi braddaa". Then, when I walked back in, I started getting the violation thing but luckily some young dudes just told me "go through brodie". NYC is awesome for the community built around not liking the system in place. 
* Got back home late and just fell asleep.
* Got called the next day for a early morning back day, which was great, followed by some hooping a swim and plenty of time in the sauna. Left there to get some matcha which was also kinda bad because they had a lot more milk, a lot less simple syrup and a little bit of Matcha powder. The other one I got was 100% better.
* I genuinely did nothing all day and then finished it all up with an everything shower.
<br /><br />
Great, fun weekend with a bad Knicks loss but overall an 8.<br /><br />

Gotta get back to it this week.
Thanks for the read.<br /><br />
