Hey everyone!<br /><br />

Blog 3!
<br /><br />
## Highlights and Lowlights<br />

* Today, I fell off in productivity.<br />
* I woke up early, made eggs on avacado toast (which is surprisingly good) and had some Crumbl Cookie.
* My goal today was to mainly fix the break that happened to the website at the end of Saturday and do some maintenance, but I had some other things to get through as well.
* Although I got the stuff for the website done, I just got super tired and had a sugar crash around 1 and basically did nothing till 5.
* Then I got up to play basketball, closed my activity rings and somehow went 23/26 from 2 and 3/7 from 5. Put me in coach
* Mainly, I watch the KNICKS COOK THANK YOU KAT. Amazing game, Knicks in 6 😴
<br /><br />
I'd rate today a 6/10. Good start and then I realized why they say life is a marathon not a race lol

Tomorrow, I have a few calls and want to just do some final touches on this website and then edit a few docs. I have to do a lot more maintenence tomorrow so I should have more free time?<br /><br />

Thanks for reading and have a good night.<br /><br />
