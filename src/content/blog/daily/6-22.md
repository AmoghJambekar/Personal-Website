Hey everyone!<br /><br />
I know it's been a minute but I'm finally back!<br /><br />
## What I've been up to<br />

* I graduated high school! Somehow!
* Had a Senior Prank and the class parties and all
* Had Senior Sunset, which had no sunset...
* Made my grad cap! and got all my cords for graduation
* Had my robotics banquet
* Went to The Weeknd concert
* And finally, said bye to a bunch of great people I've met these past four years
<br /><br />
I start work tomorrow and my internship soon. Tomorrow's plan is to mainly wake up early, breakfast and walk my dog, hit the gym (which I haven't been doing), shower, work, get home, hoop, head to an event and get home and sleep after. Busy day!  <br /><br />

I'll be back on the blogs now and thank you if you've been reading! <br /><br />
