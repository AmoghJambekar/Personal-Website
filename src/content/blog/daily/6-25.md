Hey everyone!<br /><br />
Blog #4 since being back!<br /><br />
## Today<br />

* I had work again today but I woke up on my own and left at a decent time
* Work was fun and I set up some stuff for a personal project (details coming soon) and also just had fun doing work itself
* Went home during lunch and had a very yummy sandwich 
* After I had a call which was great and I got the chance to play basketball
* My first game was decent. I got there, warmed up well (and talked to my sister) and felt good. Sure I lost 3 games 7-3, 7-4 and 5-3 but I still thought "okay, I'm not going full tilt, i'll be better in the next"
* I had one of the most dismal games after. Bricked 7 open looks, couldnt get past a single defender and played horrid all around. I realized how bad my basketball IQ was and needed to lock in.
* I played some MC on a server after and I'm locking in this time around on the server.
* I WILL BE BETTER AT BASKETBALL <br /><br />

If you read this, thank you, I appreciate it, and I'll write again soon. <br /><br />
