Hey everyone!<br /><br />
Blog #3 since being back!<br /><br />
## Today<br />

* I woke up late again for work but had to pick someone up. After, I just stayed at work for the day and did a decent amount of stuff
* Had a great margerita slice at the place next door and a good matcha boba too
* After work I didn't lift but went and hooped and actually did amazing! My warm up routine seeems like its working
* Dropped fourty in one of the games I think the 2 and D Brunson-esque role is working
* Hopefully I keep the success going tomorrow and cook up at the run <br /><br />

Bai bai! <br /><br />
