Hey everyone!<br /><br />
Blog #2 since being back! And I have a story to tell...<br /><br />
## Today<br />

* I woke up early because I had work for the first time. Missed out on the gym in the process though because I woke up too late
* Work was fun and I'm enjoying it but obviously very long hours someties
* Funny enough, I reserved a margerita slice at my local pizza shop and they just didnt hold it for me
* Came back to work, had a matcha boba thing which was awesome
* Got back home, walked the dog and then went out to dinner with my freinds which was great.
* The issue was that I accidentally went on one of the worst highways near me and got rerouted by 20 minutes...and on the way back I went to the wrong ColdStone and the plaza around us closed. I was trying to escape and had to drive on the left side of the road which was not fun. Finally got taken through the local roads and got home safe, which I genuinely don't know how I did
<br /><br />
Work again tomorrow, after which I'll probably head to the gym and I have an application and have to design an MVP for a project. Hopefully I should be able to do it and actually be productive. <br /><br />

Thanks! <br /><br />
